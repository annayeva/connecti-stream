<h2>Web Development exam project. Streaming web application ConnectiStream.</h2>

During the work on the Web Development exam project I conducted a research of the product and aimed to base the design on the best practices of UX/UI, paying attention to display versions for different media displays, architecture and optimization. 

The project objective was to create a prototype that would be used by the company for who it was developed as a foundation for the further testing, development and implementation.

In order to understand what direction the project was supposed to be heading to I will describe the purpose and the functionality of the finalised ConnectiStream web-application:

ConnectiStream can be used for organising webinars and online translations of a new kind. ConnectiStream makes it possible to reuse YouTube and Vimeo videos and live translations, meanwhile providing additional functionality, such as streaming (or lifestreaming) two videos at the same time, uploading custom subtitles for the video. ConnectiStream can be used by vloggers, NGO’s, language teachers and other individuals who are using online video streaming as a media to reach their audience. ConnectiStream gives a possibility for a room owner (person who creates the streaming) show a specific content to room users (the audience) and to provide it with their own comments, given live or prerecorded. The big advantage is that the room owner doesn’t need to own the copyrights for the video content that they are streaming as they are simply redirecting the content from YouTube or Vimeo by the means of API in a legal way. 

ConnectiStream allows to customize video content from YouTube/Vimeo by adding subs and/or giving comments in the necessary moment, by the means of the second video, that can be livestreamed or pre-recorded.


<h3>Problem formulation of the project:</h3>

How to build a frontend functionality for the platform meant for streaming video content to a group of people in a synchronised way, with the possibility for the stream owner to add second video, that could be used for adding additional input, such as commenting, teaching, entertaining?
How to make such platform’s interface communicate the right image of the product and correspond to all the major interface design and user experience quality standards?
